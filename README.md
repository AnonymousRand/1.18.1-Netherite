# 1.18.1-Netherite
Just for fun.

Optifine is integrated within this client as Fabric/Sodium seems to be incompatible.

Made with the MCP-Reborn Tool https://github.com/Hexeption/MCP-Reborn

# Installation instructions:

1. Click on "Releases" near the right side of the screen
2. Download the source code zip from the release that you want under the "Assets" tab (descriptions of each release's features are included in the releases page)
3. Extract the zip
4. Double click on the extracted folder until you see both a folder and a README.md
5. Copy that folder next to the README.md into your versions folder in .minecraft (default location of .minecraft can be accessed by pressing WindowsKey + R and typing in "%AppData%" without the quotation marks)
6. Open Minecraft launcher and click the Installations tab. Create a new installation and select the version that corresponds with this modded client (should be named 1.18.1-Netherite). Then, select this new intallation in the launcher home screen and click Play.
